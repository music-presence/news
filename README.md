## Contributing translations

You can contribute a translation of a news entry
by following these instructions:

1. Open the [`translate`](./translate/) directory on
   [github.com](https://github.com/music-presence/news/tree/main/translate).
2. Choose a news entry you wish to translate.
   This is a subdirectory with a number, e.g.
   [`1`](https://github.com/music-presence/news/tree/main/translate/1).
   If there is only one news entry it will open automatically
   and you can skip this step.
3. Choose the language code of the language you want to translate.
   For English this would e.g. be
   [`en.md`](https://github.com/music-presence/news/blob/main/translate/1/en.md).
   Ignore the file extension `md` in this case.
   You can find a list of all language codes
   [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_639_language_codes).
   A markdown file should open with some important hints.
   Please read those first before proceeding.
4. Make sure you are logged into GitHub.
   Now click on the pencil icon in the top-right corner
   to fork the repository and edit the file.
   Confirm by clicking "Fork this repository".
5. An editor should open in which you should be able to make changes.
   Translate the text between horizontal bars (---)
   and keep the notes in mind that are written in the file.
   You can switch between "Edit" and "Preview"
   to see the result of your translations.
6. Once you are done, click "Commit changes...",
   then "Propose changes".
   Wait until a new page loads,
   then click "Create pull request"
   and click "Create pull request" again.
7. Success! ðŸŽŠ Thank you for contributing a translation for a news entry!
   I will come back to you as soon as possible
   and if everything's good, you should see the translated news
   in thet app soon.
